⚠️ Attention, **Map Creator does not work locally** due to browser security reasons, as it uses JavaScript's ES Modules. Therefore, **try use the Map Creator locally using tools like Node.js, Deno, Live Server, and more**. or try using a browser that does not have these JavaScript ES Module security measures, or try disabling this in your browser. However, using the browser with this option enabled is at your own risk; this security measure is not without reason!

- Creator Note (JogaMiguelGames):

I will never, ever mess with Objects Hex Color Input again, Wow, that's such a pain to correct, I spent between two and five hours trying to fix the Hex Input, and I'm not even kidding, I'm serious 😫!

Really, i hate Hex Color Input 😅!

If anyone is going to troll with the source code in any way, please Troll All Script, except the Hex Color Input PLEASE!
